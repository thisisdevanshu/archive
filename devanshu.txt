Hello there, I am Devanshu Singh, a Computer Science graduate with a specialization in Machine Learning. I finished my Masterâ€™s in December, 2018 from the University of Florida, Gainesville.
<br>
I have an experience of three years as a Software Engineer mostly in back-end and server technologies. I have built high-performance scalable products for early-stage startups using a vast breadth of tech stacks. I have also developed USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Services Data) products for various telecom operators of South and Southeast Asia. 
<br>
I, currently, work at Barclays, New York as a Data Science Developer. I work on models that help analysts at the investment bank predict the stock market and the world economy.
